<a name="summary">Research: Interests & Summary</a>
----------
Sai Charan's doctoral research deals with Size Oblivious Programming for irregular BigData applications &amp; programming language and compiler support for parallel, distributed computing; specifically on distributed software speculation. He briefly worked on runtime monitoring support for parallel, distributed programs.

In the past, Sai proposed hyper-dimensional extensions of the [Baker's map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker's_map) to strengthen [Chaos theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) based image encryption. Sai also had a brief stint with [Optical Character Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) for his native [Telugu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_script) script using the [Discrete Cosine Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform).

This page lists Sai's [publications](#pub), [theses](#theses), [talks](#talks) &amp; [scholar links](#scholar).
