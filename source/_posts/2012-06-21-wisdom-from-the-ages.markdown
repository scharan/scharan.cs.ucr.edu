Most doctoral candidates and professors have a page with advice/guidance to prospective grad students. Well, in keeping with that tradition, here are my own favorites.

+ [You and your research](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html), Richard Hamming.
+ [The Ph.D experience](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/phd.html), Mihir Bellare, UCSD.
+ [Cargo cult science](http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm), Richard Feynman.

A more complete, comprehensive collection is Prof. Mark Leone's [how-to](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/how-to.html) page.
